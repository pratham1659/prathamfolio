                I am a driven engineering student with a passion for software
                development. My academic background and hands-on experience in
                Java, ReactJs, and various technologies equip me to contribute
                effectively to innovative projects. I am eager to collaborate on
                challenging assignments and continue my growth as a software
                engineer. Open to new opportunities and connections in the tech
                world.
